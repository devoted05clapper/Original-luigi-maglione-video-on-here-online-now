Luigi Mangione has been in the headlines since December 2024 after he was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, stalking, and several other offenses following the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

After Thompson's death, there was a national manhunt for Mangione before he was located at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on December 9.

Since the shooting, Luigi Mangione has gained widespread attention, partly due to public resentment toward insurance companies and partly because of his strikingly good looks. Today, after reports surfaced that the 26-year-old Ivy League graduate may have filmed "at least 20" videos of him having sex prior to his arrest, the fascination with him has only intensified.

Source Says Luigi Mangione Enjoyed Being 'Watched' By Others

a source close to Mangione revealed they'd seen some of the footage before, revealing it was more than amateur-style recordings.

"It wasn't just some grainy, late-night mistake," they shared. "It was perfect lighting, everything."

They continued, "He wanted to be watched. He got off on it."

The source claimed Mangione made "at least 20 videos of him having sex."

However, the other parties "are too afraid to come forward or tell anyone" because they fear they could be dragged into his ongoing legal case.

Mangione's friend, R.J. Martin, discussed the injury in depth during an interview and revealed that the suspected killer knew "dating ... wasn't possible."

On social media, netizens have been sharing their candid reactions to the claims that Mangione enjoyed "being watched" and that he may have filmed 20 videos of him having sex before his arrest.

"Streets are saying [that] Luigi Mangione filmed 20+ sex tapes," one user wrote. "Send it to me, Rachel," they finished, referencing a viral TikTok in which a lady begs her family member named "Rachel" to send her something on her cellphone.

"Luigi s*x tapes and Mayhem about to drop," another user commented. "What a week to be Italian American."

A third user clearly agreed and told their followers they'd go "insane" if they didn't see the footage.

Donald Trump Slams Those Praising Mangione

During his statement, the twice-impeached leader of the United States explained how "terrible" he found the news to be before saying people showering Mangione with praise had a "sickness."

"I think it's really terrible that some people seem to admire him, like him," Trump said. "I was happy to see that it wasn't specific to this gentleman that was killed. It's just an overall sickness as opposed to a specific sickness ... That was a terrible thing. It was cold-blooded. Just a cold-blooded, horrible killing."

"And how people can like this guy is a ... that's a sickness, actuall

He continued, "Maybe it's fake news ... It seems that there's a certain appetite for him. I don't get it."

NYC Police Commissioner Appalled At Love For Mangione

President Trump isn't the only person denouncing those who have sung and continue to sing Mangione's praises.

New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch discussed the public reception and admitted she found the reaction to be "shocking."

"We have seen a shocking and appalling celebration of cold-blooded murder," she said. "Social media has erupted with praise for this cowardly attack. People ghoulishly plastered posters threatening the CEOs, other CEOs, with an ‘x’ over Mr. Thompson’s picture as though he was some sort of a sick trophy."

"This was a senseless act of violence. It was a cold and calculated crime that stole a life and put New Yorkers at risk. We don’t celebrate murders, and we don’t lionize the killing of anyone,” she concluded.
